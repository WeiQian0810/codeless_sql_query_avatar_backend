# codeless_sql_query_avatar_backend
A Flask-based backend that processes natural language queries received from the frontend, translates them into SQL using an AI model, executes them on a structured database, and returns the results as JSON. This component acts as the core intelligence of the system, bridging natural language understanding with database querying.
